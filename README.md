# neill's micro:bit neopixel-strip demos
A collection of microbit neopixel demos used at after-school clubs, coder dojos, and jams, to stimulate ideas.  

Note that the focus with a demo is not as a code example for the kids.  Simpler examples of each demo, or at least its core concepts, will be prepared here, too, and marked with the suffix ...Example.js

* [2pRacerLEDs - 2player NeoPixel light-racing demo](2pRacerLEDs.md)
* [TugOfWarLEDs - 2player NeoPixel tug-o-war demo](TugOfWarLEDs.md)
* [Remote Light-Level to NeoPixel BarChart Demo](LightLevelBarChartLEDsTxRxPair.md)
* [SmoothRacerDemo - prototype smoother racing demo](SmoothRacerDemo.md)
* [ColourMatchInvadersLEDs](ColourMatchInvadersLEDs.md)

## Javascript on micro:bit?
These '.js' source files are from the makecode (javascript/block) editor for micro:bit.  To recreate these projects if an up-to-date .hex file or makecode project is not available, you'll need to make a new project on makecode, install the neopixel library, switch to javascript view, and paste the '.js' code from here.
