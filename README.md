# neill-microbit-neopixel-demos
A collection of microbit neopixel demos used at code clubs and jams to stimulate ideas.  

Note that the focus with a demo is not as a code example for the kids.  Simpler examples of each demo, or at least its core concepts, will be prepared here, too, and marked with the suffix ...Example.js
